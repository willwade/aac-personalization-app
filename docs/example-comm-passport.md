Communication Passport: Purpose and Overview

A Communication Passport is a concise, accessible, and personalized document designed to introduce an AAC user quickly and clearly to new communication partners. It provides essential details about the user’s communication style, preferences, important relationships, and typical conversational topics. The passport ensures smooth interactions, particularly in care environments or with unfamiliar individuals.

Structure and Content of the Communication Passport

The passport should be structured clearly, with distinct sections, easily readable text, and optionally accompanied by images or icons to enhance accessibility.

Passport Sections:
	1.	Introduction and Personal Details
	•	User’s name and preferred nickname (e.g., “John, prefers Johnny”).
	•	Brief personal statement or greeting (e.g., “Hi, I’m Johnny. I love chatting about football and movies.”).
	2.	Important People
	•	List of primary contacts, each entry including:
	•	Name
	•	Relationship (e.g., spouse, caregiver, friend)
	•	Frequency of interaction
	•	Preferred conversation topics
	•	Communication style (formal, informal, humorous)
	3.	Communication Preferences and Style
	•	User’s preferred modes of communication (e.g., AAC device, gestures, yes/no responses).
	•	Preferred communication speed and interaction style (e.g., “I prefer slow, clear questions,” or “Short sentences work best.”).
	•	Any specific communication needs or barriers (e.g., “I need extra time to respond.”).
	4.	Common Topics and Interests
	•	Clearly listed favorite topics or subjects (e.g., sports, family, gardening).
	•	Examples of preferred conversational openings or useful phrases.
	5.	Tips for Effective Communication
	•	Practical suggestions tailored for new caregivers or conversation partners (e.g., “Please speak slowly,” “Ask yes/no questions when possible.”).
	6.	Additional Information
	•	Critical medical or accessibility information (e.g., “I require eye-gaze technology to communicate,” or “I tire easily, so shorter conversations help.”).
	•	Optional: Likes/dislikes, hobbies, or interests useful for conversation starters.

⸻

Visual Appearance and Formatting
	•	Format: Digital (interactive PDF or HTML) and/or printable version.
	•	Accessibility: Large, clear fonts, high contrast colors.
	•	Layout: Sections clearly delineated, utilizing bullet points, headings, and short paragraphs.
	•	Images: Optional but encouraged—photos of the AAC user, their main contacts, or simple icons to help readability.

Implementation Guidance for Developers
	•	Store the passport content dynamically, using structured JSON data from the social graph.
	•	Render passport templates dynamically via Markdown-to-PDF or HTML generation libraries:
	•	Markdown-to-PDF: Pandoc or similar libraries.
	•	HTML Rendering: Next.js dynamic page routes, styled with Tailwind CSS.
	•	Provide easy updating capabilities to refresh content when the underlying social graph data changes.
