Certainly! Here’s a clear, illustrative example of how the Circles of Communication might look, along with how the final social graph might be structured and visualized:

Final Social Graph Structure Example:

The social graph would capture these relationships as interconnected nodes and edges in a JSON-like structure:

{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "user", "name": "User", "type": "self"},
    {"id": "alice", "name": "Alice", "type": "family"},
    {"id": "bob", "name": "Bob", "type": "family"},
    {"id": "carol", "name": "Carol", "type": "friend"},
    {"id": "david", "name": "David", "type": "family"},
    {"id": "emily", "name": "Emily", "type": "acquaintance"},
    {"id": "frank", "name": "Frank", "type": "professional"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "user",
      "target": "alice",
      "relationship": "spouse",
      "frequency": "daily",
      "topics": ["personal health", "family events", "daily routines"],
      "style": "informal"
    },
    {
      "source": "user",
      "target": "bob",
      "relationship": "son",
      "frequency": "daily",
      "topics": ["sports", "grandchildren"],
      "style": "informal"
    },
    {
      "source": "user",
      "target": "carol",
      "relationship": "best friend",
      "frequency": "weekly",
      "topics": ["gardening", "reading", "community events"],
      "style": "casual"
    },
    {
      "source": "user",
      "target": "david",
      "relationship": "brother",
      "frequency": "weekly",
      "topics": ["family history", "personal news"],
      "style": "informal"
    },
    {
      "source": "user",
      "target": "emily",
      "relationship": "neighbor",
      "frequency": "monthly",
      "topics": ["neighborhood events"],
      "style": "polite"
    },
    {
      "source": "user",
      "target": "frank",
      "relationship": "physiotherapist",
      "frequency": "bi-weekly",
      "topics": ["therapy routines", "medical updates"],
      "style": "professional"
    }
  ]
}

Visualization of the Final Social Graph:

The social graph visualization could be interactive, allowing users or caregivers to click or hover on nodes (people) to reveal detailed relationship information:
	•	Central Node (User): Positioned at the center.
	•	Connected Nodes: Surrounding nodes representing each individual from the social circles, with lines (edges) connecting to the central node.
	•	Edge Labels: Frequency and relationship type shown on hover or click.
	•	Interactivity: Clicking on nodes reveals details about conversation topics, communication styles, and recent interactions.

⸻

Example Interactivity:
	•	Hovering over Alice shows:
"Relationship: Wife | Frequency: Daily | Common Topics: Health, Family Events"
	•	Clicking Bob highlights recent conversations logged:
"Last discussed: Football match on 2024-05-12"

This detailed representation and visualization approach ensures that the social circles and graph provide clear, structured context, significantly enhancing the user’s communication experience by making AAC device suggestions highly relevant and personalized.
